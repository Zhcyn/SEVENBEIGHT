An application about airplane information and travel records.
Users need to log in to be able to access our application. So we designed a very simple login page. Next is the home page settings. We designed a blue and purple interface style, and then display the main flight information and the main list Show the customs and landscapes of different regions.
The current application is still under development, and we need to carry out a comprehensive development and upgrade of the project.
At this stage, the main test login function is to layout the main interface function modules. Some data is still using local data, and subsequent development will continue to update this part.
If you encounter problems during the test, please contact me.
